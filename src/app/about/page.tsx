        <SlideIn className="text-justify lg:text-xl text-sm">
          My journey began in 2015 when i discover something called blogger, where I shared my passion for technology through writing technical
          articles. But as I delved deeper into the world of blogging, I became fascinated with the idea of creating my own website. And so, I
          embarked on a journey of self-discovery, learning <Highlight>HTML</Highlight>, <Highlight>CSS</Highlight>, and{" "}
          <Highlight>JavaScript</Highlight> to bring my vision to life.

        <SlideIn className="text-justify lg:text-xl text-sm">
          As I experimented with building simple websites, I found myself asking,
          <span className="font-bold text-3xl">What else can I do ?</span> My curiosity led me to explore APIs, and that's when everything changed. I
          discovered <Highlight>Node.js</Highlight> and began developing Discord Applications (Bots) using Discord API, which proved to be a
          game-changer for me. The idea of being able to create something that people could use and enjoy was incredibly satisfying.

        <SlideIn className="text-justify lg:text-xl text-sm">
          With each new project, I gained more experience and skills. I taught myself <Highlight>Mongoose</Highlight>, <Highlight>React.js</Highlight>
          , <Highlight>React Native</Highlight>, <Highlight>Python</Highlight>, <Highlight>Kotlin</Highlight>, and other technologies, constantly
          expanding my toolbox. One of my proudest achievements was creating a Discord bot that could do anything the Discord API offered.The bot has
          spread widely, reaching more than <Highlight>300,000 user</Highlight>. The process was challenging, but it taught me invaluable lessons
          about determination, patience, and creativity.
